# LibDelhommeau

A Fortran 90 library for the computation of the Green function for linear potential flow BEM problems, using Delhommeau's method as in Aquaplus, [Nemoh](https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/valorisation/logiciels-et-brevets/nemoh-presentation) and [Capytaine](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01341).

Right now, this repository is just a mirror of some of the code from [Capytaine source code](https://github.com/mancellin/capytaine), but published under a more permissive license.
If you're not sure what this means, you might want to use Capytaine instead.
Please report issue and submit pull request in Capytaine repository.
